# JS Design patterns into practice

> The Mediator Pattern

When an application grows, it can be bad news for maintainability if every module can talk to every other module. A better strategy is to have all modules communicate through a mediator instead of directly. In this lesson we see one way to achieve this inter-module communication.

* Web pages and UIs can built of independent modules
* These modules should be kept separate
* Modules can communicate through a mediator
* Module that need to communicate are known as colleagues 


**Summary**

* Looked at the Mediator pattern
